# USF_R_Programming
This repository contains projects from the R Programming course at USF (LIS 5937-724), spring 2021
Assignments are completed and pushed online weekly.
Assignments are named by the weekly module number (mod for short, e.g. mod2 for module 2) followed by a short content name.
A longer description of the module will always be in the first line of code as a comment.
Since the first week's assignment was simply to create a respository on GitHub, the actual files start with module 2.
