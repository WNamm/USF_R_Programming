# USF_R_Programming
This repository contains projects from the R Programming course at the University of South Florida (course code: LIS 5937-724), from spring 2021.
Files for assignments are completed and pushed online weekly.
They are named by the weekly module number (mod for short, e.g. mod2 for module 2) followed by a short content name.
A longer description of the module will always be in the first line of code as a comment.
Since the first week's assignment was simply to create a respository on GitHub, the actual files start with module 2.
This repository also contains files that are used in or created by an R script for an assignment.
One such file is Melanoma_Data.csv, which was downloaded from the Vincent Arel Bundock database.
Documentation for this melanoma data set can be found at https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/doc/boot/melanoma.html
